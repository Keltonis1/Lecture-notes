# Homework 3 Template: Loops

# TODO: Create a loop with options:
# 1. Add Profile
# 2. Add Hobby
# 3. View Profile
# 4. Edit Profile
# 5. Exit

# TODO: Use input() to get user choice
# TODO: Add a while loop and if/elif blocks to handle options

# Hint: You need to add a profile first before you can view/edit a profile or add a hobby
#       You will need some kind of data structure outside your loop to hold information


# Supplemental (we didn't get to this, will likely go over in next lecture)
# TODO: Use list comprehension to print hobbies in uppercase
