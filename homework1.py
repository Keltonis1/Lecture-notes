# Homework 1 Template: Getting Started with Your Assistant

# Create a file named assistant.py and use it to complete the following tasks
# TODO: Greet the user
# TODO: Ask for their name, age, and if they are a student
# TODO: Store the info in variables
# TODO: Use type() to check types
# TODO: Use int() and bool() to cast input as needed
# TODO: Print the value of the variables and their types

# Example:
# name = input("What is your name? ")
# age = int(input("How old are you? "))
# is_student = bool(input("Are you a student? (True/False): "))

# print(type(name), type(age), type(is_student))
